## Install

### Standalone

Install as a standalone, change `~/bin/` to any other directory that's
in your `$PATH` if you wish.

```
curl https://github.com/chrismytton/shoreman/raw/master/shoreman.sh -sLo ~/bin/shoreman && \
chmod 755 ~/bin/shoreman
```

### Homebrew

    brew install --HEAD chrismytton/formula/shoreman

## Usage

Head into a project that has a `Procfile` in it, then simply run the
`shoreman` command, it will read your Procfile, and start up the
processes it finds. If there is a `.env` file in the directory then
environment variables will be read from it, as with foreman.

```
cd project-with-procfile
shoreman
```

## Running tests

Tests are written using [roundup](http://bmizerany.github.com/roundup/).

To run the tests, go to the root of the repository then run `make`.

```
cd shoreman
make
```
