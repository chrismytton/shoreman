# [shoreman](https://github.com/hecticjeff/shoreman) is an
# implementation of the **Procfile** format. Inspired by the original
# [foreman](http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/) tool for ruby, as
# well as [norman](https://github.com/josh/norman) for node.js.

# Make sure that any errors cause the script to exit immediately.
set -e

# ## Usage

# Usage message that is displayed when `--help` is given as an argument.
usage() {
  echo "Usage: shoreman [procfile|Procfile] [envfile|.env]"
  echo "Run Procfiles using shell."
  echo
  echo "The shoreman script reads commands from [procfile] and starts up the"
  echo "processes that it describes."
}

# If the --help option is given, show the usage message and exit.
expr -- "$*" : ".*--help" >/dev/null && {
  usage
  exit 0
}

# ## Logging

# For logging we want to prefix each entry with the current time, as well
# as the process name. This takes one argument, the name of the process, and
# then reads data from stdin, formats it, and sends it to stdout.
log() { (
  # Bash colors start from 31 up to 38. Instead of a hash set and storing a
  # bunch of variables, we will simply calculate what color the process will get
  # base on its PID
  color=$((31 + ($! % 7)))

  while read -r data
  do
    printf "\033[1;%sm%s %s\033[0m" "$color" "$(/bin/date +"%H:%M:%S")" "$1"
    printf "\t| %s\n" "$data"
  done
) }

# ## Running commands

# When a process is started, we want to keep track of its pid so we can
# `kill` it when the parent process receives a signal, and so we can `wait`
# for it to finish before exiting the parent process.
store_pid() {
  pids="$pids $1"
}

# This starts a command asynchronously and stores its pid in a list for use
# later on in the script.
start_command() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  ( eval "$1" 2>&1 ) | log "$2" &
  store_pid "$!"
=======
  $SHELL -c "$1" 2>&1 | log "$2" &
  pid="$!"
  store_pid "$pid"
>>>>>>> Run commands as the user's default shell
}

# ## Reading the .env file

# Set a default port before loading the .env file
PORT=${PORT:-5000}

# The .env file needs to be a list of assignments like in a shell script.
# Shell-style comments are permitted.

ENV_FILE=${2:-'.env'}
if [ -f $ENV_FILE ]; then
  export $(cat "$ENV_FILE" | grep "^[^#]*=.*" | xargs)
fi

# ## Reading the Procfile

# The Procfile needs to be parsed to extract the process names and commands.
# The file is given on stdin, see the `<` at the end of this while loop.
PROCFILE=${1:-'Procfile'}
while read line || [ -n "$line" ]; do
  name=${line%%:*}
  command=${line#*: }
  start_command "$command" "${name}"
  echo "'${command}' started with pid $!" | log "${name}"
done < "$PROCFILE"

# ## Cleanup

# When a `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM` or `EXIT` is received, this action is run, killing the
# child processes. The sleep stops STDOUT from pouring over the prompt, it
# should probably go at some point.
onexit() {
  echo SIGINT received
  echo sending SIGTERM to all processes
  kill $pids > /dev/null 2>&1
  sleep 1
}
trap onexit INT TERM EXIT

# Wait for the children to finish executing before exiting.
wait
